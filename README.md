# CICD-Interview-Project-Walkthrough
This is a powerpoint I created in Feb 2023 showing off a DevOps project I did including AWS, Jenkins, Terraform, Ansible, and Docker.
This project took a locally hosted Wordpress site, and built it into AWS, making it better able to handle increased traffic spikes, and we were able to make the delivery lightning fast even for viewers on the other side of the planet.
